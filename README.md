### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Julian Wirtz**, I am 23 years old and currently doing my Master in *Sustainable Management and Technology* at the EPFL in Lausanne.

Next to my studies, I am active in an EPFL-UNIL student association called *Zero Emission Group*. With our more than 50 members, we **promote sustainability** on our campus, by raising awareness and realising concrete projects.

Welcome to my Github :)
